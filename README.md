## Multi-label Classification for Multi-Drug Resistance Prediction of Escherichia coli

Motivation
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health and development threat. In particular, multi-drug resistance (MDR) is increasingly common and has become a serious problem to public health, as this can lead to failure of treatment of patients, e.g., in hospitals. Machine learning methods have a wide range of applications for AMR prediction. However, these approaches typically do not incorporate information on accumulation of resistance over time. 

In our study, we built and evaluated different multi-label classification (MLC) models, namely binary relevance classifiers (BR), classifier chains (CC), ensemble of classifier chains (ECC), label powersets (LP), and random label space partitioning with label powerset (RD), to predict MDR of Escherichia coli (E.coli) combining random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM) as base classifiers. Our results show that using multi-label classification makes it possible to significantly improve the performance of multi-drug resistance prediction in all base classifiers.
